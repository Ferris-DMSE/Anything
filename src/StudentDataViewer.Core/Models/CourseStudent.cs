    /// we need another model that is able to relate them both.
    /// In our scenario, we can simply find all of the <see cref="CourseStudent"/> objects that have the 
    /// same <see cref="StudentID"/> as a <see cref="Student"/> model in order to find all of the course IDs that
    /// the student has. From there, we just lookup the courses and we're done.
    /// 
    /// It's a little more work than just embeding a list of course objects in <see cref="Student"/>, but in terms of file managability,
    /// this pays off in a large way. Additionally, this data structure plays well with almost any potential data storage format, from XML,
    /// to JSON, to SQL Databases.

    /// In SQL terms, this type of object is called a join table.
